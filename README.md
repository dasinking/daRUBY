# daRuby
A simple ruby script platform for your Twitter bots. It includes a working oAuth process and config file writing - the basics of the basics.

## Requirements

* A Twitter account (obviously)
* Ruby 2.0+ (tested with 2.3.0)
* the following gems: yaml, twitter, oauth

## Usage

1. Add your bot code.
2. Run daRuby.rb
3. Well, that's it. It's that simple.

## sidenotes

You can use the Twitter app of mine to access the API for your first testing endeavours. I don't save any of your data. I can't access any of your files, as the auth info is saved in your config.yml, so your precious memes are safe.

Also huge thanks to @nilsding for helping.
